                <h3>How we started</h3>
                <p class="description">In 2003, the founder of 85°C Bakery Cafe, Mr. Cheng-Hsueh Wu visited a cafe in a 5-star hotel. While enjoying gourmet pastries and drinks, he realized that the prices were set way too high for people to enjoy on a whim. From that moment, Mr. Wu has envisioned a cafe that provides premium coffee, bread, and cake at affordable prices. Thus the 85°C Bakery Cafe journey begins…</p>

                <h3>Why 185°F?</h3>
                <p class="description">We believe that coffee holds its flavor best at a steady temperature of 185 degrees Fahrenheit. To us, the name 185°F symbolizes our devotion to provide coffee of the highest quality. We hope to give our customers the best drink possible.</p>
