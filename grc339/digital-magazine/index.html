                                    A cheap price tag—one of the primary reasons fast fashion companies continue to prosper. Oftentimes the argument against supporting fast fashion brands becomes elitist, completely ignoring that in many cases it is not that consumers want to support those brands, they simply have no other choice financially.

                                    Alex Ross has a thoughtful piece in The New Yorker on the Spotify backlash and the future of music consumption: "What if, in order to support musicians that you care about, you were asked to give up the very idea that all music should be available on demand?"

                                    In Tokyo, Japan; interest in the SDGs and global warming among people in their 20s is relatively low. When broken down by generation, the highest percentage of respondents in this cohort answered “did not know” when asked about the SDGs.Those who prioritize ESG issues over profits show concern about social issues such as human rights.The ESG investment recognition rate is low, at less than 20%.

                                <p>
                                    “Doing your part” is a fixture of U.S marketing schemes in terms of sustainability and ethics.  For decades the American public has been told that if you as an individual act sustainably or ethically and tell the people around you to do the same, big changes will be made.  Yet, somehow, many of the problems that this message seeks to address remain unresolved, some after decades of “trying”.

                                    Imagine this: You’re browsing online and find two different shirts you like. One is from a company you believe to have good business practices. The exact criteria don’t matter so much for this hypothetical, but let’s say it tries to use more sustainable materials and only sources from factories where workers are paid decent wages.

                                    Having different values, concerns and expectations from other generations means the younger generations have different consumer behaviour than previous generations. Despite having less purchasing power, they spend a lot. More than other generations, they want to integrate their ethical principles into their everyday consumption.

                                <p>
                                    One of the goals most of the world has agreed on is education for sustainable development. This means development that considers present concerns without compromising the interests of future generations. Nations develop through education that takes care of the present and the future.
