                                    Is it possible to preach the values of sustainability while still promoting consumption? On a small, cozy corner of the internet, mornings are spent curled up in an armchair while leisurely sipping cafe au lait from a wonky ceramic mug. Clothing is loosefitting, adheres to an earthy color palette and is often paired with chunky handmade clogs

                                    The accumulation of evidence of the global and systemic nature of the problem has been sufficient to convince most that any genuine solution must involve radical changes to society as a whole, rather than just a shift in the consumption choices of individuals

                                    A cheap price tag—one of the primary reasons fast fashion companies continue to prosper.  Oftentimes the argument against supporting fast fashion brands becomes elitist, completely ignoring that in many cases it is not that consumers want to support those brands, they simply have no other choice financially

                                    Alex Ross has a thoughtful piece in The New Yorker on the Spotify backlash and the future of music consumption: "What if, in order to support musicians that you care about, you were asked to give up the very idea that all music should be available on demand?"

                                    There’s a saying that there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism. But is there such a thing as consumption — and frankly, participation — in capitalism that’s fair? It can feel nearly impossible to understand, and even harder to navigate

                                    “Doing your part” is a fixture of U.S marketing schemes in terms of sustainability and ethics. For decades the American public has been told that if you as an individual act sustainably or ethically and tell the people around you to do the same, big changes will be made, but any of the problems that this message seeks to address remain unresolved, some after decades of “trying”
